A beginner-to-intermediate reference guide for working with the Linux command line, file system, permissions, and processes.

📂 File System Hierarchy
Directory	Purpose
/	Root directory
/home/	User home directories
/etc/	System-wide configuration
/var/	Variable files (logs, cache)
/usr/	User utilities and applications
/bin/	Essential user binaries
/sbin/	System binaries
/tmp/	Temporary files
/dev/	Device files
/proc/	Process and kernel info

🖥️ Common Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
pwd         # Show current directory
ls -l       # List files with details
cd /path    # Change directory
cp src dst  # Copy files/directories
mv src dst  # Move/rename
rm file     # Remove file
mkdir name  # Create directory
🔍 File Viewing & Searching
bash

🛠️ File Permissions
Symbolic Format: rwxr-xr--
r = read, w = write, x = execute

First block = owner, second = group, third = others

chown user:group file      # Change ownership
📄 File Redirection
bash
Copy
Edit
command > file     # Redirect output (overwrite)
command >> file    # Redirect output (append)
command < input    # Redirect input
command1 | command2  # Pipe output to another command
⚙️ Process Management
bash
Copy
Edit
ps aux             # List all processes

kill PID           # Kill process by PID
killall name       # Kill all processes by name
&                  # Run in background

free -h                  # Memory usage
uptime                   # System uptime
whoami                   # Current user
🔐 SSH & File Transfer
bash
