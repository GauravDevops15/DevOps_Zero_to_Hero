📘 Ansible Notes
Ansible is an open-source tool for IT automation—used for configuration management, app deployment, and task orchestration.

⚙️ Overview
Agentless: Uses SSH or WinRM (no need to install agents).

Written in: Python

Playbooks: Written in YAML

Used for:

Automating server setup

Application deployment

Configuration management

📁 Core Components
1. Inventory
A list of target hosts:

ini
Copy
Edit
[web]
192.168.1.10

[db]
dbserver.example.com
2. Modules
Pre-built commands to perform tasks (e.g., ping, copy, service):

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible all -m ping
ansible web -m shell -a "uptime"
3. Playbooks
YAML files describing tasks:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
4. Roles
Structured folder layout for reusable playbooks:

Copy
Edit
roles/
├── webserver/
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── handlers/
│   └── templates/
5. Facts
System information automatically collected via the setup module.

🧰 Common Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-inventory --list           # List inventory
ansible-playbook site.yml          # Run playbook
ansible web -m ping                # Ping all web hosts
ansible web -m apt -a "name=nginx state=latest"
📦 Useful Modules
Module	Purpose
ping	Test connection
copy	Copy files
template	Deploy templated config files
service	Start/stop services
apt/yum	Package management
user	Manage system users

🔐 Privilege Escalation
Use become: yes to run tasks with sudo:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Update system
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
🧠 Best Practices
Use roles for cleaner code organization

Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data

Prefer idempotent tasks (run safely multiple times)

Use tags to run specific parts of playbooks
